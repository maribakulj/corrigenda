Both parser.py and rewriter.py need identical _detect_namespace / _tag

here prevents the parser config drifting between call sites — a class

default parser, exposing it to entity-expansion DoS).

        Defeats internal-entity amplification ("billion laughs") and any
        residual external-entity leak across lxml versions.
      - ``no_network=True`` — refuse to fetch external DTDs / entities.
        Defeats SSRF via ``<!DOCTYPE x SYSTEM "http://...">``.

        already; pinned here for clarity (a future maintainer flipping
        validation on would silently re-enable DTD loading).

    Returns a FRESH parser instance per call: lxml parsers are not
    documented as thread-safe and the construction cost is microseconds.

    Use this for EVERY ``etree.parse`` / ``etree.fromstring`` call that
