"""Format-agnostic XML helpers shared by every transcription format.

lxml lives here — so this module is NOT part of the pure ``core`` (the
import-contract test allows ``formats`` to import lxml) — but it is NOT a
format either: namespace detection, tag qualification, and the hardened
parser are identical for ALTO, PAGE, and any future format.

Homing them here keeps the format packages *siblings* — ``alto → _xml ←
page`` — instead of making one an accidental base that the other reaches
sideways into (the former ``page → alto`` edge, which meant deleting or
refactoring ALTO would break PAGE). Each format's ``_ns`` re-exports these
three under its existing private names, so call sites are unchanged.

        Defeats internal-entity amplification ("billion laughs") and any
        residual external-entity leak across lxml versions.
