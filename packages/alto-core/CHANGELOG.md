## [Unreleased]

### v1.0 normative corrections (SPECS_LIB_V2 §7) — in progress

- **F3** — the parser tolerates comments / processing-instructions among a
  `TextLine`'s children (they carry a callable `tag`); a trailing comment
  no longer aborts the whole file.
- **F5** — `_int_attr` parses float-valued coordinates (`"123.0"`, `"800.9"`)
  via `int(float(...))`, truncating toward zero. Non-numeric values still
  raise.
- **F6** *(byte change)* — slow-path token geometry: the 0.6 space weight now
  enters the total weight and rounding is spread by cumulative rounding.
  Widths still sum exactly to the line width; the final token only absorbs
  residual rounding instead of every space's accumulated deficit. Changes
  output bytes on slow-path lines with interior spaces (UNTOUCHED /
  SUBS_ONLY / FAST paths unaffected).
- **F13** — `GuardConfig` (frozen, injectable) gathers every anti-migration /
  acceptance threshold from the three guard stages; defaults reproduce the
  historical constants byte-for-byte. `FrozenPolicy.policy_fingerprint()`
  gives a stable hash for provenance (§11). Threaded through `check_line`,
  `check_adjacent_duplicates`, `reconcile_hyphen_pair`,
  `validate_llm_response`, and `CorrectionPipeline(guard_config=…)`.
- **F7** — `PairingPolicy` (frozen, injectable) makes hyphen pairing a seam;
  default reproduces the historical purely-sequential pairing. Forwarded
  through `build_document_manifest` / `parse_alto_file`.
- **F2** *(byte change)* — a changed `CONTENT` drops the now-stale `WC`/`CC`
  confidences (fast path, per changed String); the slow-path rebuild
  recycles only `ID` and `STYLEREFS` (§6.1 whitelist), inherits `VPOS`/
  `HEIGHT` from the line, recomputes `HPOS`/`WIDTH`, and never carries
  `WC`/`CC`/`SUBS_*`. Changes output bytes on slow-path lines and on
  fast-path Strings whose CONTENT changed.
- **F4** — the UNTOUCHED comparison strips both sides, matching the parser's
  `ocr_text` derivation; a line with a trailing `<SP/>` under identity
  correction now takes the UNTOUCHED path instead of being rewritten.
- **F9** — `RetryPolicy` (frozen, injectable) externalises the temperature
  ramp, attempt cap, backoff bases and per-chunk budget.
  `RetryPolicy.default()` reproduces the historical ramp (0.0/0.3/0.5, cap 3)
  to the byte; `RetryPolicy.deterministic()` sets every temperature to 0.
  `CorrectionPipeline(retry_policy=…)`.
- **F10** — `CorrectionPipeline.run(should_abort=…)` cooperative cancellation,
  probed between pages and chunks; raises `CorrectionAborted` (new
  `alto_core.errors` module, `CorrectionError` root) before any output is
  written. In-flight provider calls are not interrupted.
- **F1** *(behaviour change on failure paths)* — a chunk whose retry budget is
  exhausted is re-planned one granularity finer (PAGE→BLOCK→WINDOW→LINE) and
  retried (`chunk_downgraded` event), bounded by `RetryPolicy.per_chunk_budget`
  (default 6). Only lines whose finest-grain chunk still fails fall back to OCR;
  a transient burst now recovers instead of reverting the whole chunk. New
  `chunk_downgraded` event added to the SSE contract.

### Changed
- **Retry policy on HTTP 4xx (other than 429) is now non-retryable.**
  The previous class-name allowlist (`exc.__class__.__name__ ==
  "HTTPStatusError"`) caused `401`, `403`, `404`, `422` to be retried
  3 times with exponential backoff — a waste, because client errors
  (bad API key, wrong model, schema rejection) don't heal on retry.
  The classifier now routes on `isinstance(exc,
  ProviderTransientError)`, and providers' HTTP wrapper deliberately
  leaves 4xx-non-429 errors un-wrapped, so they reach the classifier
  as non-retryable and the chunk falls back to OCR source on the
  first failure. Pinned by
  `test_pipeline_classifies_client_http_4xx_as_non_retryable`.
  `5xx`, `429`, and transport-level failures (timeout, network,
  protocol) retain the previous 3-attempt exponential-backoff
  behavior.
- Clarified in the `### Added` section of `[0.1.0a1]` which symbols
  are re-exported at the package root (`from alto_core import …`)
  versus the ones that are sub-module-only. The technical contract
  is unchanged — every symbol previously listed remains importable
  from its canonical path. (roadmap L5 / B5)

### Added
- `ProviderTransientError.status_code: int | None` — when the
  underlying transport failure was an HTTP error, the originating
  status code is preserved on the wrapped exception so observers can
  route on 429 vs 503 vs 500 without parsing the message. `None` for
  transport-level failures (timeout, network, protocol). The full
  underlying exception remains reachable via `__cause__` for callers
  that need response headers or the request URL.

### Documentation
- Public Pydantic models (`LineManifest`, `DocumentManifest`,
  `BlockManifest`, `PageManifest`, `JobManifest`, `ChunkPlannerConfig`,
  `LLMLineInput`, `LLMLineOutput`, `ModelInfo`, `Coords`) and enums
  (`JobStatus`, `LineStatus`, `ChunkGranularity`, `Provider`,
  `HyphenRole`) now carry a one-line docstring. PyPI consumers get
  IDE help/intellisense out of the box. (roadmap L5 / A5)

### CI / Release
- Single source of truth for the smoke-import check:
  `packages/alto-core/_smoke_imports.py` iterates `alto_core.__all__`
  and is invoked by `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
  `.github/workflows/publish-alto-core.yml`, and
  `scripts/release-alto-core.sh`. Drift between the three is now
  impossible. (roadmap L5 / B6)
- Added `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.13` classifier
  (`requires-python = ">=3.11"` already permitted 3.13). (roadmap L5 / P3)

## [0.1.0a1] — 2026-05-25

Initial alpha release.

### Added

> **Import paths.** Each section below documents the path the listed
> symbols live at. Most are sub-module imports, e.g.
> `from alto_core.alto.rewriter import RewriterMetrics`. The shorter
> set of names re-exported at the package root —
> `from alto_core import CorrectionPipeline, BaseProvider, ...` — is
> defined exclusively by `alto_core.__all__`. Symbols listed below
> that are NOT in `__all__` (e.g. `RewriterMetrics`, `ReconcileMetrics`,
> `plan_page`, `validate_llm_response`, `AcceptanceResult`, …) are
> sub-module-only: they remain importable from their canonical path,
> but `from alto_core import RewriterMetrics` will raise `ImportError`.

- `alto_core.alto`: ALTO XML parsing and rewriting (v2/v3/v4), with
  the Hyphenation Reconciler.
  - `parse_alto_file`, `build_document_manifest` *(top-level)*
  - `rewrite_alto_file`, `extract_output_texts` *(top-level)*, `RewriterMetrics` *(sub-module only)*
  - `enrich_chunk_lines`, `reconcile_hyphen_pair`, `ReconcileMetrics`,
    `classify_reconcile_outcome`, `should_stay_in_same_chunk` *(all sub-module only)*
- `alto_core.pipeline`: chunk planning, LLM-response validation,
  per-line acceptance policy, and `CorrectionPipeline`.
  - `CorrectionPipeline`, `CorrectionResult`, `sanitize_error` *(top-level)*
  - `plan_page`, `downgrade_granularity` *(sub-module only)*
  - `validate_llm_response` *(sub-module only)*
  - `check_line`, `check_adjacent_duplicates`, `AcceptanceResult` *(all sub-module only)*
- `alto_core.protocols`: ports consumers implement.
  - `BaseProvider`, `PipelineObserver`, `OutputWriter` *(top-level)*
  - `OUTPUT_JSON_SCHEMA`, `SYSTEM_PROMPT` *(top-level, on `alto_core.protocols.provider`)*
- `alto_core.schemas`: domain Pydantic models (manifests, enums, LLM
  payloads, traces, model info). Top-level re-exports cover the
  models consumers typically reach for — see `alto_core.__all__`.

### Public API guarantees (alpha caveat)
- Importable via the top-level package: `from alto_core import
  CorrectionPipeline, BaseProvider, parse_alto_file, …` (full list
  in the package `__all__`).
- Each sub-module declares its own `__all__`.
- ARCHITECTURE.md ADR-006: the pipeline never logs by itself — every
  diagnostic is an `observer.on_event(...)` so hosts route them as
  they wish.
- Snapshot tests on a 566-line corpus pin byte-identical rewrite
  output across the 35+ commits of the refactor that produced this
  release.

### Known limitations
- API is still alpha; breaking changes possible until 1.0.
- `CorrectionPipeline.run` accepts `provider_name`/`model`/`api_key`
  individually (server-side legacy); a future release will likely fold
  them into the injected `BaseProvider`.
